**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The requirements for the option I chose, Option 1: Inventory App, the app needed a database with at least two tables. One table needs to store user logins and passwords and the other to store the inventory items. The app needed a login screen that allow users to login as well as create a login for new users. A screen with a grid that displays all items in the inventory database. A mechanism for the user to add and remove items for the inventory as well as a mechanism for the user to increase and decrease the number of a specific item in the inventory. Lastly, the app needed a mechanism by which the app will notify the user when the amount of any inventory item has been reduced to zero. The user needs this app was designed to address is securely tracking inventory items and their quantities. 

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

For this project I needed a login and create new user screen keeping the users inventory and their adjustments secure. A Main Activity screen which displayed the grid layout that displays all the items in the inventory database and their quantities. This screen also allowed the users to increment or decrement the inventory item quantities with arrow buttons. I created an add item screen so the user can add up to five items at a time to the inventory database. I also created a screen for a help menu, so the user can have a better understanding of how the app works and how to use it properly. My UI design kept users in mind by keeping is simple and straight forward with as few screens as possible to prevent too much back and forth between different screens. My design is successful because it was user centered and could be used in a different situations. 

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?**

I used a lot of planning for this project, including visual representations of the different screens and a pseudocode to keep me on track while coding the functionality. I coded one element at a time for example I completed all the login functions first, tested the code frequently, once there was no mistakes I moved onto the next requirement. These techniques can be applied in the future by always having a plan for a project to keep code clean and organized, well commented, and tested thoroughly. 

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?**

I tested my code often by using debug and running the app the ensure there was no issues with the code. I used the emulator to ensure it was running properly and I found I did have some issues that I needed to adjust. This process is important because it reveals compatibility issues, runtime issues, and what is causing the app to crash. 

**Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

When planning for the UI design I had a vision in mind, but when I started creating the UI in Android Studio I found that I had to make adjustment for the UI to function properly and be user-friendly and self explanatory. This proved to be a bit of a challenge but I kept making adjustments and trying different techniques until I found the solution I was happy with. 

**In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

The specific component of my mobile app that I felt was particularly successful is my UI design, because I kept the user in mind at all times and ensured the design is user-friendly, reusable, and visually appealing.
