**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The requirements for the option I chose, Option 1: Inventory App, the app needed a database with at least two tables. One table needs to store user logins and passwords and the other to store the inventory items. The app needed a login screen that allow users to login as well as create a login for new users. A screen with a grid that displays all items in the inventory database. A mechanism for the user to add and remove items for the inventory as well as a mechanism for the user to increase and decrease the number of a specific item in the inventory. Lastly, the app needed a mechanism by which the app will notify the user when the amount of any inventory item has been reduced to zero. The user needs this app was designed to address is tracking inventory items and their quantities. 

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**
**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?**
**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?**
**Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**
**In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**
